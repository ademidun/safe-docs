# Build a Batch transactions Safe App

## What are we building?

This tutorial will build a Safe App that enables us to migrate all the assets from a Safe to any other wallet in a single transaction. It doesn't include NFTs, but this is a great thing to do on your own. In addition, you will learn about smart contract wallets, multi-signature transaction flow, and batched transactions.

Find the Github repo with the complete guide [here](https://github.com/gnosis/safe-apps-sdk/tree/master/guides/drain-safe-app).

### Prerequisites

We'll assume that you are familiar with TypeScript (JavaScript), React, and Ethereum and have `node.js` and `npm` installed.

### Help

If you need help, you can reach Safe developers in the #safe-developers channel in [https://chat.safe.global](https://chat.gnosis.io) or create a discussion in [https://github.com/gnosis/safe-apps-sdk/discussions](https://github.com/gnosis/safe-apps-sdk/discussions).
