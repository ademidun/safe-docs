# Safe Protocol Kit (Safe Core SDK)

The Safe Protocol Kit uses the [safe-core-sdk](https://github.com/safe-global/safe-core-sdk/tree/main/packages/safe-core-sdk), which is a TypeScript library for interacting with the [Gnosis Safe contracts](https://github.com/safe-global/safe-contracts)

## Getting Started

This is a short tutorial on creating a Safe using the core-sdk. For a more detailed guide, including how to integrate with safe-core-service and web3js, see [Integrating the Safe Core SDK](https://github.com/safe-global/safe-core-sdk/blob/main/guides/integrating-the-safe-core-sdk.md).
