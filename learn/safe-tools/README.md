# ðŸ”§ Safe Tools

### SDKs

We provide multiple software developments kits (SDKs) to interact with the Safe smart contracts from different platform and for different use cases.

* **Safe Apps** are decentralized applications that can be seamlessly integrated in the [Safe interface](https://app.safe.global).
* The **Safe Core SDK** is a TypeScript library that facilitates the interaction with the Safe contracts and services.
* The **Contract Proxy Kit** (**CPK**) provides a simple way to create Safes that can be used to leverage the advantages of smart contract wallets in your decentralized application.
